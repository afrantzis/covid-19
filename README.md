## Interactive time series graph of confirmed COVID-19 cases per country

This repository contains a self-contained web page that displays an interactive
graph of confirmed COVID-19 cases per country. It works completely on the
client side (with embedded javascript) and dynamically downloads the latest data
from the [John Hopkins CSSE repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

It supports both automatic and manual synchronization of the displayed time series
to help compare trends.

To use this page clone the repo and point your browser to the contained index.html
file.

Alternatively, you can access this page online at https://afrantzis.com/covid-19/.
